  relativeGapThreshold:
    description: |
      Relative gap threshold at which to consider a solution optimal
    type: number
  absoluteGapThreshold:
    description: |
      Absolute gap threshold at which to consider a solution optimal
    type: number
  timeoutMillis:
    description: |
      Upper bound on solving time. Note that the overall attempt time may
      be greater due to processing outside of the solve itself.
    type: number
  zeroValueThreshold:
    description: |
      Positive magnitude below which values will be assumed equal to
      zero. This is also used on solution results, causing values to be
      omitted from the solution if their dual value is also absent. It is
      finally used as threshold for rounding integral variables to the
      nearest integer. The default is 1e-6.
    type: number
  infinityValueThreshold:
    description: |
      Positive magnitude used to cap all input values. It is illegal for
      the reified problem to include coefficients higher or equal to this
      value so the input needs to be such that they are masked out during
      reification. The default is 1e13.
    type: number
  freeBoundThreshold:
    description: |
      Positive magnitude used to decide whether a bound is free. This
      value should typically be slightly smaller to the infinity value
      threshold to allow for small offsets to infinite values. The
      default is 1e12.
